Have you ever wanted to turn **coding mistakes into measurable feedback? Impact Counter** is a Python utility for [Jupyter]([url](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/)) and [Google Colab]([url](https://colab.research.google.com/)) that logs notebook errors, and counts failures - letting you use tracked errors in impact play as **reinforcement learning to improve your coding over time**. 

Perfect for:
- Turn notebook crashes into actionable insights
- **Gamify debugging with error accountability**
- Measure coding progress over time
- Learn Python by reinforcing better coding habits

### Features:
- 🔥 Real-time counter — see how many times your code failed
- 📝 Error logging — keeps track of what failed, when, and in which function
- ☁️ Backend support — store logs locally (SQLite) or in the cloud ([Airtable]([url](https://airtable.com/developers)))

## Repository Structure
This repo contains the Python package (colab_error_logger), a sample notebook, and scripts for logging errors and syncing them with Airtable or SQLite.
